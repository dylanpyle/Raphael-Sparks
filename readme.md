# raphael-sparks
An Ã¼ber-simple particle generator for [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com).
Very much a work in progress. Some goals include:

* Becoming a Raphael plugin rather than just a stand-alone script
* Fixing *all the bugs*. There are many.

## Usage
```
var sparks = new ParticleGenerator (paper);
sparks.updatePosition(200, 200);
sparks.start();
```
